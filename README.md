# Project corresponding to FulStackOpen part5 - UNIT TESTS -

FullStackOpen's Section 5 has been splitted in 2 different projects/repositories

    - unit tests are found in this repository in 2 different files under the names 'Blog.test.jsx' and 'BlogForm.test.jsx'. It contains the resolution of exercises from 1 to 16.

    - end to end tests are found in another repository: 

    https://github.com/FabricioPaoloni/-fullstackopen-part5-end-to-end-tests.git

    inside the folder '/tests' in the file 'blog_app.spec.js'. It contains the resolution of exercises from 17 to 23.

I used *Playwright* library to complete the end to end tests (exercise 5.17 to 5.23)

A copy of the steps.txt file has been added to both repos in order to make it easier to find it - contains every step I made to accomplish the section

All tests uses this backend: 

https://github.com/FabricioPaoloni/fullstackopen-part4

All tests uses this frontend: 

https://github.com/FabricioPaoloni/fullstackopen-part5-unit-tests

Remember to install all the dependencies for ./bloglist-frontend and also the dependencies for ./end-to-end-tests, they are 2 different npm projects; remember to install the backend dependencies as well
 
### -

To run the unit tests, you can run in a terminal situated in the *bloglist-frontend* project's folder the following command:
    - npm run test

To run the end to end tests, first you have to execute two terminals process, one for the backend and the other one for the front end:   
    - initialize backend with testing database in a terminal located at *backend's project folder*:
        ~ *npm run start:test*
    - initialize frontend in a terminal located at *bloglist-frontend project's folder*:
        ~ *npm run dev*

Then you can run in a third terminal situated in the ./end-to-end-tests folder the following scripts (after executing the 2 terminal's process for frontend and backend):

    ~ *npm run test* 
    
    to run the end to end tests (terminal located at ./end-to-end-tests folder); or 

    ~ *npm run test:report* 
    
    to access the playwright report (terminal located at ./end-to-end-tests folder)
